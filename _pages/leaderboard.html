            <p class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-0">On April 22nd, 2023 three international teams gathered to participate in the 
                2023 IEEE UAV Chase Challenge. Team HighFlyers (Poland), BioRobotics (Italy), 
                and EDrone (China) were selected for their exceptional solutions from the first 
                simulation round of the competition. 
            </p>
            <p class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-0">The task for all three teams was the same. Build a custom solution for a UAS that can 
            autonomously detect and track a rover traveling in a large city, while performing obstacle avoidance in a miniature city. 
            </p>
            <p class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-0"> The results for the competition are shown in the Table. The maximum score possible is 100% and is achieved by staying within 1 meter of the rover during following and tracking. The score was a
                 weighted average across 4 trials of varying difficulty.
